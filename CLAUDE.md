# Daily Cipher Challenge System - Development Guide

## Project Overview

This project implements an automated daily 3-puzzle sequence system using Google Apps Script, Gemini AI, Google Sheets, and Landbot integration. The system generates fresh cipher challenges daily featuring a cohesive narrative: decrypt a word, answer trivia about that word, then encrypt the trivia answer using the same cipher system.

## Quick Start Commands

### Google Apps Script Development

- Setup automation: `setupDailyTrigger()`
- Deploy as web app: `doGet()` function for API access

### Google Sheets Setup
- Create new Google Sheet: "Daily Cipher Challenges Database"
- Setup 15-column structure (A-O) for complete puzzle sequence
- Setup helper formulas in row 1 (P1-Y1) for Landbot integration
- Test formulas: `=INDEX(D:D,MATCH(TODAY(),A:A,0))` for encrypted word
- Verify cipher validation and data retrieval

### Landbot Integration
- Connect to Google Sheets via Landbot integrations panel
- Create 10+ variables for 3-puzzle sequence management
- Build 3-stage conversational flow with puzzle progression

## Integration Specifications

### Google Apps Script Functions

**Core Functions Required:**
```javascript
generateDailyPuzzle()          // Main daily automation function
callGeminiForPuzzle()          // API integration with error handling
getTodaysPuzzle()              // Current puzzle retrieval
setupDailyTrigger()            // Automation configuration
isAnswerCorrect()              // Enhanced answer validation
validatePuzzleQuality()        // Content quality checking
getFallbackPuzzle()            // Reliability failsafe
```

**API Integration Patterns:**
- Use UrlFetchApp for external API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
- Store API credentials in Properties Service
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Handle rate limiting and quota management

### Google Sheets Formula Integration

**Essential Formulas for Landbot:**
```
Today's Question: =INDEX(B:B,MATCH(TODAY(),A:A,0))
Today's Hint 1:   =INDEX(C:C,MATCH(TODAY(),A:A,0))
Today's Hint 2:   =INDEX(D:D,MATCH(TODAY(),A:A,0))
Today's Hint 3:   =INDEX(E:E,MATCH(TODAY(),A:A,0))
Today's Answer:   =INDEX(F:F,MATCH(TODAY(),A:A,0))
```

**Data Validation Rules:**
- Date column must be unique and properly formatted
- Question length should be 50-200 characters
- Hints should be progressively more specific
- Answers should have clear alternatives listed
- All content must pass family-friendly validation

### Landbot Configuration

**Variable System:**
- @question: Current puzzle question
- @hint1, @hint2, @hint3: Progressive hints
- @correct_answer: Primary correct answer
- @user_answer: User input capture
- @hint_count: Track hints used
- @attempt_count: Track total attempts

**Conditional Logic Framework:**
```
Answer Validation:
IF answer_matches(@user_answer, @correct_answer) → SUCCESS
IF @attempt_count >= 5 AND @hint_count >= 3 → REVEAL_ANSWER
ELSE → OFFER_HINT_OR_RETRY

Hint Progression:
IF @hint_count = 0 → OFFER_HINT_1
IF @hint_count = 1 → OFFER_HINT_2
IF @hint_count = 2 → OFFER_FINAL_HINT
```

## Development Philosophy

Focus on creating a magical, engaging experience while maintaining robust, reliable technical systems. Every user interaction should feel effortless and encouraging, while the backend systems should be resilient and self-healing.

Prioritize user experience over technical complexity - the technology should be invisible to users, enabling them to focus entirely on enjoying the daily puzzle challenge.

Remember that this system will run autonomously once deployed, so invest heavily in error handling, monitoring, and fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent daily operation without manual intervention.

## AI Collaboration Guidelines

When developing this system with AI assistance:
1. Always consider both user safety and experience quality
2. Implement robust error handling for all external dependencies
3. Test all integrations thoroughly before deploying to production
4. Document all changes and configurations for future maintenance
5. Validate all external API responses before processing
6. Design for graceful degradation when components fail
7. Focus on creating delightful user interactions at every touchpoint

This system represents the intersection of artificial intelligence, automation, and user engagement - ensure that all three aspects receive equal attention during development.
