Hi, This is a pre-planned prompt that's all about exploring how else I can scale this auto-generated daily set of puzzles (right now it's just 3 stages) into a more. Is there a way to scale it into 5 with it being somewhat of a cohesive storyline while making it so I can just show it in Landbot? 

Every game should be fun and ideally build on one another. What other text based puzzles can I do? How complicated can this be? 

Can I have AI reliably do something like providing lists of cities to create a pre-planned word? Or show a picture of a thing? 

What other options are there for me to scale this up into something with compltely auto-generated puzzles. 

Ideally it can be a repeatable storyline. I'm not sure how to scale it to something with mutliple storylines. 

The summary of how this currently works is having google sheets apps script call to gemini daily and generate new puzzles and Landbot (integrated into the tryreason.com website) will present each puzzle in a somewhat clever story. The puzzles should come quickly in the storyline so ideally there's not too much expositiono but there will be some to keep it more aligned with a cohesive story. 

Please review through everything in the main structure to get a deep understanding of how this currentlly works. Please lookup tryreason.com to get a good concept of it. Can you please ultra deepthink this and provide a few suggestions.
